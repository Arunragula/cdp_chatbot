## Overview

The CDP Chatbot is a web-based application designed to provide support and answers for Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) such as Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. Built with Flask, this chatbot offers an interactive chat interface where users can ask "how-to" questions related to setting up, configuring, or comparing these CDPs. It uses predefined documentation and implements fuzzy matching to deliver relevant responses, making it a valuable tool for developers and businesses working with CDPs.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time interaction.
- **CDP-Specific Support**: Answers questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap, including setup, tracking, audience creation, and more.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Implements fuzzy logic to match user queries to documentation, improving response accuracy.
- **Feature Comparison**: Allows users to compare features between CDPs (e.g., "How does Segment compare to Lytics?").
